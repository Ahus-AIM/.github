Artificial Intelligence Medical Informatics (AIM) is a research group at Akershus University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.

We conduct research on medical informatics with an emphasis on artificial intelligence and its enabling technology. The research group consists of data scientists, IT engineers and medical professionals as we believe an interdisciplinary approach is key to success. Similarly, our collaborations span across most divisions of the hospital, including medicine, surgery and psychiatry, as well as the primary care of surrounding municipalities.
